Drink Tracker iOS app

This is the source code for an app I wrote that calculates BAC based on drink inputs.

You can build it on your own device if you want.

Also, it serves as an example of a basic app for tracking simple quantities over time, with inputs/graphing etc.

It used to be on the app store until Apple unilaterally pulled it citing that they are disallowing BAC calculators since they aren't medical measurements.

Ok? I was only making like 20 cents a day in revenue tops.

This app has dependencies (or rather, used to) several Cocoapods:

pod 'CorePlot', :git => â€˜https://github.com/core-plot/core-plot.git'
pod 'Google-Mobile-Ads-SDK', '~> 7.0'
pod 'JTCalendar', '~> 2.0'
pod 'IAPHelper'
pod 'iRate', '~> 1.11'
